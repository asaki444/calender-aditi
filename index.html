        For this exercise, I would first refactor the code to make it more DRY. I found that I had a lot of repetitive code, especially when populating the contents of the calendar. It is not possible to add dynamically add divs, and manipulate the contents of
        those divs. Therefore, I had to add each div in the html file. I, also need to separate the code into functions to make it more readable. So that others can see the process.
        <p>
            I would rather use React or JQuery to render the contents of the calendar. I could have a week component that would render for each week of the month. It would be a lot easier to maintain, and add to.
        </p>

        <p>
            I did not quite find the proper font that matches the design, or the gray color for the buttons, underline, and border around the calendar. And I am not sure if the spacing between elements is correct.
